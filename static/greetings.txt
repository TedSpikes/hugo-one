Filmed in breathtaking, beautiful color
The upper echelon of mediocrity
Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory
As seen on TV!

Condemned by the Space Pope
Filmed on location
Cough, then fall over dead
Hey, Siri
The vivid, pulsating miracle that gives substance to shadow
Weather wise, it's such a lovely day
Head to toe, so player
Got whosits and whatsits galore
Fights like a Krogan, runs like a leopard
From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell
Butterball has a hotline?
You will now hear the voice of the Russian moon
Nobody cares but me, but I do care
ELO kiddie
First!
What the hell is water?
Now we are all sons of bitches
We’re gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon
Please understand
Shazam!
Creepy, like when Tom Cruise laughs
Aw skeet skeet
It is the business of goats to climb
Don’t even get me started on this microphone
The Stardew Valley Hat Mouse of people
Conscience does make cowards of us all
Ra Ra Rasputin Russia’s smollest uwu bean
Yes Future!
No retreat, baby, no surrender!
For the benefit of the working class
What a time to be alive
You’re my pride and joy, etc.
Stay sexy and don't get murdered
You will live to see man-made horrors beyond your comprehension
Consciousness was a mistake
Oh, growl ye may, but go ye must
*guitar solo*
Craig Mod, who’s that?
A trash can fire in a prison cell

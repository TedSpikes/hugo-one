Filmed in breathtaking, beautiful color
The upper echelon of mediocrity
Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory
As seen on TV!
Loading…
Condemned by the Space Pope
Filmed on location
Cough, then fall over dead
Hey, Siri
The vivid, pulsating miracle that gives substance to shadow
Weather wise, it's such a lovely day
Head to toe, so player
Got whosits and whatsits galore
Fights like a Krogan, runs like a leopard
From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell
Butterball has a hotline?
You will now hear the voice of the Russian moon
Nobody cares but me, but I do care
ELO kiddie
First!
What the hell is water?
Now we are all sons of bitches
We’re gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon
Please understand
Shazam!
Creepy, like when Tom Cruise laughs
Aw skeet skeet
It is the business of goats to climb
Don’t even get me started on this microphone
The Stardew Valley Hat Mouse of people
Conscience does make cowards of us all
Ra Ra Rasputin Russia’s smollest uwu bean
Yes Future!
No retreat, baby, no surrender!
For the benefit of the working class
What a time to be alive
You’re my pride and joy, etc.
Stay sexy and don't get murdered
You will live to see man-made horrors beyond your comprehension
Consciousness was a mistake
Oh, growl ye may, but go ye must
*guitar solo*
Craig Mod who?
A trash can fire in a prison cell
The future is now, old man
Way, hey, and up she rises
A little bit of joy and color in an otherwise unbearably bland life
No one outpizzas the hut
The last refuge of a scoundrel
Cheaper than therapy
So, now what?
I come from Chino where the asphalt sprouts
That mopey, dopey menace
My phone gets the internet now!
It’s amateur night in Dixie
Stingy with the mustard
Feels like an ocean being warmed by the sun
He’s the original party worm!
Sky king, Sky king, do not answer
Set SCE to AUX
Something rises from the lake
Maximum effort
Let go, and move on
What's with these homies dissin' my girl
Littering and smoking the reefer
Roughly the shape of a potato
My business card says you're in luck
A terror since the public school era
Ball so hard
Friend to the farmers
Gentle hum of the old machines
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics72. 
Shine a little light on my soul
The elephant really ties the room together
Hanging in, ain't no doubt
Hanging tough, over and out
Halfway between the gutter and the stars
Smiling politely
You know the music, time to dance
Merry Christmas, lizards!
Sometimes your opponent is just having a really good day
I don't know why so many of y'all wanna be thugs anyhow
